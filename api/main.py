It facilitates the construction of information systems with novel combinations of robustness, decentralization, privacy, cost, and flexibility. Beyond their initial use in cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin, blockchains have become a promising and powerful technology in business, financial services, law, and other areas. This course covers blockchain technology in a comprehensive, systematic, and interdisciplinary way. It surveys major approaches, variants, and applications of blockchains in these areas. Beyond a solid grasp of the principles, the course aims to build familiarity with practice through numerous case studies and hands-on projects. To facilitate its interdisciplinary perspective, this course will be open to two categories of students: students with Computer Science background (graduate or advanced undergraduate), and graduate students with a substantial Business or Law background and a working knowledge of computer programming. Projects will be done in heterogeneous teams combining these categories, and will center on devising and analyzing sample applications of blockchain technology, including both prototype implementations and analysis of its business/legal implications. Topics covered: disentangling \u201cblockchain\u201d; cryptographic prerequisites; assets and their representations; on-chain programming; state consensus; deployments; decentralized applications (Dapps/Web3); protocol governance; protocol revenue and business models; market structure; privacy and authorization; regulation.

Coming-of-age stories aim to provide insight into a matter of perennial concern: how, over time, do we come to make sense of the world and find our place in it? In this course, we will look at ways novelists have tried to represent this process, and consider the social and political perspectives these narratives convey. What norms and values do such works affirm? Which do they challenge? How have questions of gender and of sexual or racial otherness been handled in the coming-of-age tale? What can readers learn from these books? We will also attend to aesthetic aspects of the novel as a genre, and we will engage with past and current scholarship on the Bildungsroman and its evolution as we develop our skills in research, writing, and analysis. Likely authors include Charlotte Bronte, E.M. Forster, Anzia Yezierska, Jacqueline Woodson, Jhumpa Lahiri, and others. Required of concentrators in English. Satisfies CAS WR 150 requirement.

It considers differences in literature produced by European authors during the last decades of the age of imperialism--roughly, 1890 to the end of World War II--and literature produced by authors indigenous to formerly colonized areas during the age of decolonization--roughly, post-World War II to the present. We will question how such authors--on either side of these historical and geographic divides--reflect on the practical and moral problems that the colonial project unleashed, as well as on the enduring problems and urgent questions it has left unresolved throughout the world. Works include Joseph Conrad's Heart of Darkness, E.M. Forster's A Passage to India, Ngugi wa Thiong'o's A Grain of Wheat, Ruth Prawer Jhabvala's Heat and Dust, and Upamanyu Chatterjee's English, August: An Indian Story.

Likely works include Achebe's Things Fall Apart, its \"sequel\" No Longer at Ease, and his later, blistering critique of post-colonial Nigeria, Anthills of the Savanah; Ngugi wa Thiong'o's A Grain of Wheat and Devil on the Cross (originally written in Gikuyu but translated by the author himself into English); Tayeb Salih's Season of Migration to the North; and Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie's Half of a Yellow Sun and Americanah. Works are read carefully to discern the political, cultural, and aesthetic strategies employed by African novelists to \"tell their own stories.\" Students also study debates among African authors about African literature, in particular the question of whether to write in English, as well as scholarship on issues such as colonialism and neo- colonialism.

The Anglo signifier \"Latinx\" already announces the contemporaneity of our exploration, that it can only be happening in the now, and in an U.S. cultural and political context that violently struggles to understand (and manage) the increasing complexity of diversity. Our work is also intersectional in nature, as the term \"Latinx\" insists on being read not just as a complex marker of ethnicity and/or race, but also of gender, sexuality, class, nation, and political orientation.",

        "description": "Some of our most basic beliefs, when scrutinized, lead to absurd conclusions. For example, using only beliefs that seem uncontroversial, we can conclude that motion is impossible, that everyone is bald, and it is impossible to give a surprise exam. Carefully scrutinizing the reasoning that leads to these absurdities often yields substantial philosophical insight. In this course, we will examine a number of such puzzles and paradoxes in detail.

We cover the analysis of reasoning with truth-functions (\"and\", \"or\", \"not\", \"if ... then\") and with quantifiers (\"all\", \"some\"), attending to formal languages and axiomatic systems for logical deduction. Throughout, we aim to clearly and systematically display both the theory underlying the norms of valid reasoning and their applications to particular problems of argumentation. The course is an introduction to first-order quantificational logic, a key tool underlying work in foundations of mathematics, philosophy of language and mind, philosophy of science and parts of syntax and semantics.

        "description": "May be repeated for credit if topics are different. Topics for Spring 2024, SECTION G1: Israel in Comparative Perspective. On the basis of systematic comparisons between Israel and the USA, the course focuses on such issues as democracy, diversity, immigration, antisemitism, racism, nationalism, and colonialism. Comparisons are also made with Israel's neighbors in the Middle East and other societies. SECTION J1: Social Movements and Contentious Politics. When the explosive social movements shook the established institutions in the West during the 1960s, protesting strategies started to be seen as a political resource strategically adopted by people that are poorly positioned to access formal channels for political claim-making. This course aims to examine the basic theories and concepts and explore the major questions in the social movements and contentious politics literature. It revolves around such questions as: Why and how do social movements begin and organize? Why are some successful while others fail? How do governments around the world respond to disruptive non-institutionalized politics? To answer these questions, we employ insights from various perspectives, including those from comparative politics, anthropology, sociology, and social psychology. Cases of social movements and protests around the world, such as the 2019\u201320 Hong Kong protests and Black Lives Matter movement, are drawn to ground students in the set of tools of systematic analysis. SECTION W1: The Politics of Natural Resource Governance in Latin America. History of extractive industries: colonialism, foreign investment, nationalization, privatization, institutional building in the recent decade. The interplay of international and domestic politics. Resource-based social conflicts. Country case studies across the region.",
